## Development Workflow

### 1. Testing Different Roles
1. Use dev mode to quickly switch between roles
2. Test role-specific features and permissions
3. Verify proper access control and navigation

### 2. Admin Testing
1. Access admin dashboard to test management features
2. Use mock data to test various scenarios
3. Verify analytics and reporting functionality

### 3. Integration Testing
1. Test complete user workflows across roles
2. Verify data consistency between different interfaces
3. Test error handling and edge cases

## Security Considerations

### Development Only
- Dev mode is only available in non-production environments
- Dev keys are simple and not secure for production use
- All dev mode data is mock data and not persistent

### Production Safety
- Dev mode components are automatically disabled in production
- Admin routes are protected by proper authentication
- All admin operations require valid authentication tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dev Mode Button Not Visible**
   - Ensure you're in development mode
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify component is properly imported

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Clear localStorage and try again
   - Check if dev keys are correct
   - Verify role selection

3. **Navigation Problems**
   - Check if routes are properly configured
   - Verify role-based access control
   - Check browser console for errors

### Debug Information
- Dev mode state is stored in localStorage
- Check `devMode`, `devRole`, and `devUserData` keys
- Monitor network requests for API calls
- Check browser console for error messages

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Data Seeding**: Automatic test data generation
- **Scenario Testing**: Predefined test scenarios
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics
- **API Mocking**: Complete API simulation for testing
- **Automated Testing**: Integration with testing frameworks
